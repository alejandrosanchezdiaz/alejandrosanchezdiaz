### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After having studied Biology and Psychology, my first "Hello World" was something completely new and outstanding for me.

Step by step I've found a world that I love. I think it's wonderful to be able to create things from scratch. From the simplest mobile app to the latest AI humanoid robot. Now I want to take my first professional steps as a programmer, continue learning more and more about new technologies and languages â€‹â€‹and find people who enjoy this world as much as I do and from whom I can learn. After one year working with these technologies, I would like to have the opportunity to continue to work with Java on the Back-end, but also JavaScript, HTML, CSS and everything related to the Front-end development.

In return, I offer effort, hard work, motivation, desire to learn, problem-solving skills and ability to adapt to all kinds of situations and changes, everything with a positive attitude.
